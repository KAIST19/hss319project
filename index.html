                <h1>Introduction</h1>
                <p>The capacity for linguistic communication used to be a defining trait of human uniqueness. Yet, with language models now able to replicate this skill, we, who have seldom reflected on the essence of human identity, find ourselves deeply challenged. To be prepared for the upcoming AI era, we need to better understand the difference between the way humans and language models speak.</p>
                <p>However, the attempts to understand these two are often made on very different scales. While human languages are usually considered as emergent properties (e.g. psychology and literature), language models’ languages are analyzed with very reductionist approaches. There is no such thing as human language architecture—like the transformer model for language models—or language model psychology.</p>
                <p>Tho questions I aim to answer in this project: 1) “What’s the transformer model’s counterpart for humans?” and 2) “Considering language models as a human, how do they speak?”</p>

                <h1>The Questions</h1>
                <h2>Q1. Reductionism: Human language in the perspective of AI </h2>
                <p>To understand what the transformer architecture’s counterpart is for humans, I will explore a variety of concepts ranging from biology to psychology and linguistics. For the biology part, the topics will include the regions that are responsible for language production in the brain (e.g. Wernicke’s area, Broca’s area, and auditory dorsal stream), and for the linguistics part, I will mainly talk about universal grammar.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Listening & Reading</li>
                    <li>Speaking & Writing</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Q2. Emergence: AI-generated text in the perspective of humans</h2>
                <p>The emergent properties that language models have will be explored by projecting them onto the stories and essays from the HSS319 course. While scientists attempt to explain phenomena from the fundamental principles, authors do the opposite of what scientists do: describing phenomena on a more abstract scale. With the help of the authors, we can project the language models onto their creations where we can observe the production of language models on new dimensions.</p>

                <p>Imagine you are playing chess. In the beginning, you don’t know how this game will end because you can’t see all the possible cases ahead. But, with the several moves you can see ahead, you play chess in a quite intelligent way.</p>
                <p>Writing is similar to playing chess. Although you don’t know how it will end, you can see some words ahead and that allows you to write in a quite intelligent way. If you were a Heptapod, you would have been able to see all the possible movements and write in the best way possible. What about ChatGPT? How many moves can it see ahead? Only one.</p>
                <p>This is called beam search in computer science. It’s an algorithm whereby ChatGPT finds the next word, and it doesn’t let you see what set of words you will get after the next turn. It’s playing chess without seeing any moves ahead of the one it is now making.</p>

                <p>What if language models were another species? What if they were a species that could only communicate through books? What would their books look like? What would their books be about?</p>
                <h3>Why I write: the language model’s version of “Why I write.”</h3>
                <p>What motivates language models to write? What if "Why I Write" by George Orwell was written by ChatGPT?</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>
                <p>I believe that, whichever questions we have regarding AI, these two questions will be the ultimate questions we will have to answer. By comparing human language and language models’ language in a more proper way, I believe we can truly understand how we speak, how AI speaks differently from us, and develop our AI literacy.</p>
