            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The capacity for linguistic communication used to be a defining trait of human uniqueness. Yet, with language models now able to replicate this skill, we, who have seldom reflected on the essence of human identity, find ourselves deeply challenged. To be prepared for the upcoming AI era, we need to better understand the difference between the way humans and language models speak.</p>
            <p>However, the attempts to understand these two are often made on very different scales. While human languages are usually considered as emergent properties (e.g. psychology and literature), language models’ languages are analyzed with very reductionist approaches. There is no such thing as human language architecture—like the transformer model for language models—or language model psychology.</p>
            <p>My final project aims to answer two questions: 1) “What’s the transformer model’s counterpart for humans?” and 2) “Considering language models as a human, how do they speak?”</p>
            <h2>The Questions</h2>
            <h3>Q1. Reductionism: Human language in the perspective of AI </h3>
            <p>To understand what the transformer architecture’s counterpart is for humans, I will explore a variety of concepts ranging from biology to psychology and linguistics. For the biology part, the topics will include the regions that are responsible for language production in the brain (e.g. Wernicke’s area, Broca’s area, and auditory dorsal stream), and for the linguistics part, I will mainly talk about universal grammar.</p>
            <h3>Q2. Emergence: AI-generated text in the perspective of humans</h3>
            <p><b>Considering language models as a human, how do they speak?</b><br>The emergent properties that language models have will be explored by projecting them onto the stories and essays from the HSS319 course. While scientists attempt to explain phenomena from the fundamental principles, authors do the opposite of what scientists do: describing phenomena on a more abstract scale. With the help of the authors, we can project the language models onto their creations where we can observe the production of language models on new dimensions.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>I believe that, whichever questions we have regarding AI, these two questions will be the ultimate questions we will have to answer. By comparing human language and language models’ language in a more proper way, I believe we can truly understand how we speak, how AI speaks differently from us, and develop our AI literacy.</p>
